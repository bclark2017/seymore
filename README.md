I have, in the past, struggled greatly with watering my succulents.
I turned a few years back to a zero_scape lawn [because Iâ€™m
majoring in agriculture (STEAM)]. The real reason, though, was
because I was really bad at watering my lawn.

Mission: Combine STEM with A (Agriculture) to create a digital garden. Use
the arduino to monitor temperature, moisture, and light for a
succulent.
